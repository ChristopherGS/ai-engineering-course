    "summary": "Alessio, CTO of Residence at Decibel Partners, and Michael Hosewicz, founder of Small AI, welcome Dylan Patel, author of the SemiAnalysis blog, to their podcast. Dylan discusses the feasibility of building up semiconductor capacity in the US and China's potential impact on the US supply chain. He emphasizes the fragmented nature of the semiconductor supply chain and the existence of many monopolies. Dylan suggests that while the US could theoretically shut down the Chinese semiconductor supply chain, and vice versa, it is unlikely to happen."
