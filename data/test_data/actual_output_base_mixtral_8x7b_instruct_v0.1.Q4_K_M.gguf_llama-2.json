    "summary": "Alessio, CTO of Residence at Decibel Partners, and Michael Hosewicz, founder of Small AI, welcome Dylan Patel, author of the SemiAnalysis blog, to their podcast. Dylan discusses the feasibility of building up semiconductor capacity in the US and China's potential impact on the US supply chain. He emphasizes the fragmented nature of the semiconductor supply chain and the existence of several monopolies. While he asserts that the US could shut down the Chinese semiconductor supply chain, and vice versa, he notes that it is unlikely to happen."
