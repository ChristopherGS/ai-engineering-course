it's a little difficult for me to believe that it's been nine years as of the day that this
podcast this episode releases it's been nine years since this podcast started and i'm so grateful
for everything that i've learned on this show by the way i've got a little bit of a cold you might
be hearing that but i couldn't let this particular date pass without releasing an episode cold or not
this podcast has meant so much to me uh over the last nine years don't worry i'm not getting ready
to announce that we're canceling or anything like that i just want to take a moment to reflect
and say thank you it's very rare that i talk about myself my personal feelings on this show
at least anything deeper than my opinions but i'm very fulfilled by the opportunity to do this
podcast and i know the years it has changed and it will continue to change just like i will continue
to change and that's actually what we're going to talk about after this reflection this moment
of reflection for me we're going to talk about how you can configure your brain
for change to invite change but i do want to take a moment and just show my appreciation for all of
you who are listening right now maybe this is the first time you're listening maybe you've been
listening for nine years maybe you followed us all the way through when we were a part of the
spec network maybe you've been with us since the very beginning in our earliest sponsored days
or throughout all of the many interviews that we've done with the awesome guests whatever
your journey with developer t has been
i just want to say that i sincerely appreciate that you're spending a few moments of your life
listening to me talk on this podcast we may never meet in person some of you i have met
in person or i've met you virtually online but this is such a meaningful thing to me it's become
a part of my kind of routine my self-reflection routine so many times something will happen in
my personal life i'll have some experience or i'll have some insight while i'm just
hanging out with my family or when i'm exercising or if i'm participating in one of my ridiculously
long list of uh of hobbies that i have and this show is always in the back of my mind if i have
an epiphany that i feel like is worth sharing uh it happens in all parts of my life and this truly
is an extension of who i am so thank you so much uh genuinely from the bottom of my heart
i've enjoyed doing this so much and i can't wait to do more of it
i have been asked many times uh either implicitly or explicitly how i've done this show for so long
how can i keep going for so long and the truth is that i don't feel like i've done the same thing
for nine years most of the people who listen to the show you might uh perceive that a little bit
differently because the show in large part when it actually gets delivered uh when you're when
you're hearing the show you're still hearing the same
true music as we started with nine years ago right so there are uh not a not a ton has changed about
this me standing in front of a microphone and sharing my opinions sharing insights from my
experience in the industry uh you know interviewing other people all of these format things have not
changed drastically we have had some shifts in topics etc but the way that i interact with
what i'm doing has changed significantly there have been scheduled changes there have been
patterns of change there have been changes in the way that i interact with what i'm doing
there have been patterns of change there have been changes in the way that i interact with what i'm doing
there have been patterns in my life that i've been able to adjust so that the output of the show
doesn't really necessarily have to change very much but everything surrounding it can change
pretty drastically especially my own expectations this is probably the critical factor and the one
i want to hone in on in this discussion today my expectations for what this show could or should be
have changed on a very regular basis over the course of my life
the last nine years and in some ways that affects what i do with the show in terms of the types of
content that i might produce or the kinds of guests i might have on but the biggest thing
that it allows me to do is continue regardless of what happens this is the key to persistence at
least in this particular case the key to persistence for me and i suspect that the key to persistence
for you may look very similar adjusting your own expectations or a better way to put it is
reducing the power of your expectations reducing the power of your expectations
now this sounds like i'm going to go into some kind of like buddhist teaching or something here
but that's not really the intention the intention is to identify areas where you have an expectation
of what will occur
whether it's with a podcast or with your code or with your career with your family or friends
looking at those expectations and holding them loosely because here's what can happen
if we build up an expectation if we build up an expectation we begin to wrap our actions
in our thoughts around that expectation and instead of thinking about the thing that we're
doing in that moment we're going to be thinking about the thing that we're doing in that moment
instead of thinking about say the process instead of thinking about writing that particular piece
of code with quality in mind we start to think about some expectation and by the way expectation
doesn't necessarily have to be some irrational you know load that you're putting on a situation
it can be totally rational your expectation of what should happen what is likely to happen what
could happen all of these things are going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be
these types of expectations we bring them to the table we begin to wrap all of what we do around
them and in fact the purpose for the thing that we're doing becomes the expectation
think about this as it plays out in your normal life or in your life as a software engineer
let's imagine that you are working your job as a associate software engineer whatever your
entry-level position or mid-level position software engineer and in no uncertainty
certain terms you really love your job you enjoy your day-to-day work you enjoy the people you work
with you enjoy the kind of problems that you're solving you feel sufficiently challenged you feel
excited but that little expectation starts to grow inside of you the expectation of getting
a promotion of achieving a particular title or maybe even a salary your work continues you keep
on enjoying every day that you walk into work but now the expectation is kind of
living alongside that you know that reviews are around the corner you're going to be either up
for promotion or not you talk to your manager they put you up for promotion and you get a rejection
now this expectation that you had has created a differential it's created a picture of something
that you ostensibly thought would be good for you or would be desirable for you this fork in the road
but it's
all a fiction it never actually happened it's just a comparison point that you've created
uh in your own mind it's all a fiction and so now you're in some kind of suffering
uh you're experiencing a negative feeling you're experiencing frustration or or maybe you're
feeling a sense of imposter syndrome maybe you begin to develop resentment towards your manager
or resentment towards your manager or resentment towards your manager or resentment towards your
people who uh ultimately made the decision not to promote you and what otherwise was an excellent
job that you were enjoying yourself you could have continued on the promotion had you not developed
an expectation a promotion would be a bonus right something that you appreciate instead your
expectation turned it into something that you felt like you lost now let's think about this for a
second you lost your expectation you lost your expectation you lost your expectation you lost your
expectation you lost your expectation you obviously didn't lose
anything but because you've trained your mind into thinking about an expectation
your mind is an incredibly powerful thing right you've developed this very thorough story about
yourself in a future world where that expectation has been met and now you're living in a world where
that expectation has not been met and because your brain can't really tell the difference between
imagination and reality you're not able to tell the difference between imagination and reality
well you actually feel a sense of loss when i first started developer t i actually had the
opposite experience i didn't really know what was going to happen with the podcast i was very
fortunate i was uh very lucky that the podcast gained the traction that it did and i had the
opposite experience it it was my expectation that i would continue working on the podcast for years
before it ever gained traction or something like that uh but it gained traction very early and so
something broke my expectation and i was like oh my god i'm gonna lose my mind i'm gonna lose my
positive way but then as the years went on the previous performance of the podcast i thought i
was having a rational response as i was looking at the numbers they can look at the listenership
for example and if one episode dipped below another episode i realized that there was a
differential between my expectation of how that podcast episode should have performed and how it
and now i'm trying to rationalize in my mind the reason for the differential just like you might do
that if you didn't get the promotion well why didn't i get the promotion maybe i'm not good
enough for the promotion maybe i screwed something up maybe i said something wrong maybe that
particular project i could have worked extra hours on and maybe that would have impressed
my boss's boss's boss all of these things are born out of the differential between reality and
our expectation and so i would spend
time trying to analyze what kind of content is it that has a better listenership than other content
what kind of seasonality should i expect there's all of these things that i was trying to calibrate
my expectations i was trying to change the way that i would expect so i could be more accurate
with my expectations in the future and this is again a rational thing to do we want to be able
to predict the future it's one of the things that we really want to do as humans because predicting
the future allows us to reduce risk and
also take advantage of benefits that we can see coming down the road so predicting the future is
a natural tendency to want to uh try to you know evaluate our expectations and tune them so that
they're better but what i realized is that all of that tuning was not really the core of why i
started the show to begin with i didn't start this show as crazy as it seems uh purely for the
pursuit of making the show as crazy as it seems i didn't start the show as crazy as it seems
podcasts are not the money-making tree that you might expect that they are i've been fortunate
enough to make some money with this podcast you know that because you've heard episodes in the
past where i've had sponsors but i didn't start this with that in mind and so the listenership
of the show started to compete for the core reason i started this podcast in the first place
it took me a while to find the tagline that you all probably have heard
but to help developers find clarity perspective and purpose is my core reason now if i can have
if i can help more developers do that then even better that's great but what i failed to do was
recognize that the number of engineers listening to the show the number of uh you know audience
per episode the number of unique downloads i was starting to tune myself towards that number
rather than allowing that number to be an outcome that i don't have any control over
i was trying to control that outcome i was trying to align my expectations and correct
my process to improve the outcomes towards my expectations sometimes this is a reasonable
thing to do sometimes you should do this but in this case i was losing the plot i was losing the
core reason why i started the show in the first place so one of the things that i'm doing i've
been doing it for a couple of years i've been doing it for a couple of years i've been doing it for a couple of years
now is i'm actively trying to reduce my expectations of developer t and in other areas of my life
reduce the uh the uh the leverage that my expectations have over my life because the
truth is in that situation where you didn't get that promotion that you thought you were going to
get it's very tempting to say you know what that's it i'm throwing in the towel i'm leaving this
company i'm going to go somewhere that actually respects me and i'm going to go somewhere that
me you know respects my my experience and it's going to give me the title that i want and this
is how uh your expectations can stop you from continuing something that you really love doing
you really love that job but you decided to stop it because your expectations created a differential
between your reality which by the way you really enjoyed and some other reality that never was true
when listenership has waxed
and waned over the years of this show i could have thrown in the towel i could have said you
know what i can't attract the same number of listeners i can't attract the same kinds of
sponsors anymore because my listenership is down and therefore it's not worth doing my expectations
of this show uh have have failed in that case right i i expected to have x number of listeners
therefore i could get y number of sponsors and i've had less than x therefore the show
is over and i'm not going to be able to do it again i'm not going to be able to do it again
no longer worth doing this again is losing the plot right so evaluate those expectations i really
encourage you to take a few minutes uh whether you're doing it now or later um write down some
areas of your life where you have maybe in the past year upon reflection you've had some
expectations that you failed to meet whether it's expectations of yourself maybe it's expectations
of other people something that was significant
and try to imagine what it would have been like had you not developed expectations it's very hard
to do by the way don't don't get me wrong this is not something that's it's easy to do but when we
develop expectations and then we invest in those expectations that's really where we go wrong
expectations on their own are kind of a natural byproduct of our thinking brain we have some
expectation of what will happen but when we start to invest in that expectation we're not going to
when we start to plan on it we start making changes based on it that's where things can get
a little bit wonky now briefly i want to make sure that you understand i'm not talking about
creating plans plans are these longer term expectations we have of what we might do in
the future instead think about this as the meta layer for example i expect that i will fulfill
all of my plans
this is a meta expectation that i have of what's going to happen
with my planning process my planning is going to be perfect that would be an expectation
the plan itself is just what you think about doing what you're planning to do is not necessarily an
expectation of how things are going to go probably the easiest line to draw in the sand is expectations
are about outcomes that you can't control while plans are more like inputs that you can control
our expectations are about what you think about doing what you're planning to do and what you're
doing Dent convert which can quickly your expectations reflect what we believe about the efficacy of our
planning but our expectations also mask our inability to recognize all of the many factors
that may impact outcomes beyond our control ultimately i've been incredibly happy to do
this show and i expect to continue being happy doing this show uh and the way that that that
I ensure that that will happen is that I focus on that core reason why I started doing the show in
the first place. And if that disappears, then I will. I will shut the show down, but I don't see
that disappearing anytime soon. And that's because of all of you. Thanks so much for listening to
